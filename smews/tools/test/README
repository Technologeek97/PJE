How to test your apps in smews.

Warning : The tests can only be launch with a python version >= 3.2.0

1) you have to place your application in the apps/test/ directory.
2) you write test and place it in the tools/test directory (you can group your test in a sub directory)
3) this test work only on the linux target

to lauch the test, you must launch the follow command as root
	~/ scons test=true

This command 
	compile SMEWS with apps, which are in the apps/test directory 
	launch SMEWS on the 192.168.1.2 ipAdress
	launch all test which are write in the tools/test directory and its subdirectory 

You can see test example in the tools/test directory.

What it work?
	
	- Example with file Simple_GET test

	#!/usr/bin/python
	import socket
	import sys
	import time 
	import os

	# create couple HOST (IP address), PORT
	HOST,PORT = sys.argv[1],80
	# the send request
	request = 'GET /test/post/get_test_1 \r\n\r\n'
	correctAck = 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\n'
	correctAnswer = 'Hello World!'
	# create the socket
	sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	# connection to the server
	sock.connect((HOST,PORT))

	sock.send(bytes(request,'UTF-8'))

	# receive the server answer
	data = sock.recv(1024)

	# close the socket
	sock.close()

	if(correctAck in str(data) and correctAnswer in str(data)):
		sys.exit(os.EX_OK)
	else:
		sys.exit(os.EX_SOFTWARE)


Each test send a HTTP request to the server, and receive it. 
So you have just to change the request field and the last test, with your own test on receive data.
You have to exit the test with sys.exit(os.EX_OK) (that means, that the test is OK) or with sys.exit(os.EX_SOFTWARE)(that means, that the test is KO (fail))	


You have different kind of test yet implemented in the directory tools/test.
